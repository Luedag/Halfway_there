# Halfway_there
Estimation and classification projects for a meal delivery service company, developed as a part of the MSBA at Hult International Business school. The Jupyter Notebooks show examples of EDA and predictive modeling for two separate tasks

This project was developed for the Machine Learning course during my current Master in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School. Using data from a company that provides a meal delivery service (ingredients are delivered so the customer can finish cooking themselves) 

The file Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx contains the dataset with information for all customers during the one year. The file Apprentice_Chef_Data_Dictionary.xlsx provides details for each variable.

Estimation project:

The objective was to identify patterns and information that could help estimate total revenues from customers.

The notebook regression_eda.ipynb details the process developed for EDA and modeling. Please note that it will work as long as it is executed from Jupyter notebook from a folder that also contains the file Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx

The script Regression_Model.py can be executed from any Python interpreter and contains exclusively the steps for the creation of the regression model used. It also outputs its performance metrics.

Classification project:

The objective was to identify patterns and information that could help predict adoption of an add on feature. The company offers an additional wine delivery service called “Halfway There”. Customers who sign up for this add-on receive half a bottle of wine on Wednesdays, from local vineyards. 

The file Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx contains the dataset with information for all customers during the one year. The file Apprentice_Chef_Data_Dictionary.xlsx provides details for each variable.

The notebook classification_eda.ipynb details the process developed for EDA and modeling. Please note that it will work as long as it is executed from Jupyter notebook from a folder that also contains the file Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx

The script Classification_Model.py can be executed from any Python interpreter and contains exclusively the steps for the creation of the classification model used. It also outputs its performance metrics.

The file Executive_Summary.pdf provides key insights from the analysis process and a few recommendations and guidelines.
